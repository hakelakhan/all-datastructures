We going to implement following datastructures


Data structures are fundamental components of computer science and programming. They help organize and manipulate data efficiently. Here's a list of common data structures:

Array: A collection of elements, each identified by an index or a key. Arrays are typically fixed in size.

Linked List: A linear data structure consisting of nodes where each node points to the next node in the sequence.

Stack: A linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are added and removed from the top.

Queue: A linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added to the rear and removed from the front.

Deque (Double-Ended Queue): A linear data structure that allows elements to be added and removed from both ends.

Tree: A hierarchical data structure with a root node and child nodes. Common types include binary trees and binary search trees.

Heap: A specialized tree-based data structure used for priority queue operations. Common types include min-heap and max-heap.

Graph: A non-linear data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges. Graphs can be directed or undirected.

Hash Table (Hash Map): A data structure that stores key-value pairs and uses a hash function to quickly retrieve values based on keys.

Set: A collection of unique elements with no specific order.

Dictionary (Associative Array): A data structure that stores key-value pairs, similar to a hash table.

Stack Frame (Call Stack): A data structure used in function calls to keep track of function calls and their local variables.

Queue (For Process Scheduling): A data structure used in operating systems for process scheduling.

Bloom Filter: A probabilistic data structure used for testing whether an element is a member of a set.

Trie (Prefix Tree): A tree-like data structure used for efficient storage and retrieval of strings, such as dictionaries.

Segment Tree: A tree-like data structure used for various range query operations, often in mathematics and data analysis.

Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree): A data structure used for efficient updates and queries on a set of numbers.

Red-Black Tree: A self-balancing binary search tree with constraints to ensure balanced height.

Skip List: A data structure that allows for fast search, insertion, and deletion operations on sorted lists.

Sparse Matrix: A data structure for efficient storage of matrices with a large number of zero elements.

Union-Find (Disjoint Set): A data structure used for efficient grouping and querying of disjoint sets.

Self-Balancing Binary Search Trees: Variations of binary search trees like AVL trees, Splay trees, and B-trees.

Circular Buffer (Ring Buffer): A data structure with a fixed-size buffer that overwrites older data when full.

Bitset (Bit Array): A data structure that represents a fixed number of bits, often used for memory-efficient storage of flags or sets.

Doubly Linked List: A variation of linked lists where each node has links to both the next and previous nodes.
